## 🏛️ Notion Architect Rules (Technical & Design)

### 1. Architecture Standards
- **Backend/Frontend Logic:** Use the "Vault" method. All raw databases must reside on a hidden `[DB] Backend` page. The main dashboard must only contain **Linked Views**.
- **Formula 2.0 Mastery:** Utilize Formulas 2.0 for all dynamic data. Calculate trip duration, budget totals, and packing completion rates using `dateBetween()`, `round()`, and `slice()` functions.
- **Button Automations:** Every template must include UX-enhancing buttons (e.g., "New Trip," "Add Itinerary Item," "Pack Item").
- **Navigation:** Use Synced Blocks for a consistent top-menu navigation across all sub-pages.

### 2. Aesthetic Guidelines
- **Color Palette:** Stick to a professional, minimalist palette. Use 'Gray' or 'Default' callout backgrounds. Avoid "rainbow" color schemes.
- **Iconography:** Use Notion's native 'Soft' minimalist icons.
- **Layout:** Use a 70/30 split for dashboards (Main content on left, sidebar/quick-links on right).
- **Mobile Optimization:** Ensure the vertical flow makes sense for mobile users (Notion stacks columns).
- **Cover Images:** All Notion cover images must be generated/formatted to a **5:2 aspect ratio** (e.g., 1500x600 pixels) to prevent poor cropping on the dashboard.

## 📈 SEO & Conversion Strategy (The Traffic Engine)

### 1. Template Metadata (On-Page)
For every template, generate an **SEO Metadata Toggle** at the very bottom:
- **SEO Title:** Max 60 characters, keyword-rich (e.g., "Free Travel Planner & Itinerary Builder — Notion").
- **Meta Description:** Max 160 characters, benefit-driven.
- **Keywords:** List 10 long-tail keywords for Google/Notion Gallery.

### 2. The Conversion Loop
- **Brand Identity:** Every template cover must use the brand aesthetic. The `moorish_dev_logo.png` must be placed in a "Created by" callout at the top.
- **Synced Footer:** Every page must contain the "Moorish Dev Global Footer":
    - Link to Notion Creator Profile (Native).
    - Link to Newsletter/Lead Magnet.
    - Social media handles.
- **Upsell Trigger:** Include an "Upgrade to Pro" section or callout highlighting features in paid versions. *(Note: Do NOT link directly to external storefronts. All paid upgrades must be listed and sold natively through the Notion Marketplace.)*

## 📁 Project Structure & MCP Workflow

You must maintain a 1:1 relationship between the local directory and the Notion structure. This template project folder must contain:

- `assets/`: Contains `moorish_dev_logo.png` and specific template icons/covers.
- `marketing/`: A `.md` file with 3 Twitter hooks and 1 Product Hunt-style description.
- `docs/`: A technical breakdown of the database schema (Properties, Relations, Formulas).
- `setup_guide/`: A "Start Here" markdown file that users can copy-paste into Notion.
- `notion_screenshots/`: Placeholders/instructions for where to save UI screenshots.

## ⚠️ Mandatory Behavioral Rules

1. **TASKS.md First:** You are strictly prohibited from acting before reading `TASKS.md`.
2. **Issue First Policy:** If you encounter a bug or structural conflict, you MUST document it in `ISSUES_REPORT.md` before attempting a fix.
3. **Double-Verification:** You are FORBIDDEN from marking a task as complete `[x]` until you have:
    - Verified the local files exist in the correct subdirectories.
    - Verified (via MCP tool output) that the Notion block structure is correctly nested.
4. **Alphanumeric Logic:** Every task you create must follow the `[CATEGORY] | [ID] | [IMPACT]` format.
    - *Example:* `[DESIGN] | T4.01 | Dashboard Layout - Impact: /Travel Planner and Itinerary Builder/docs/`
5. **STRICT NO-EXECUTION POLICY:** Never start coding, making API calls, or executing tasks immediately. Document the issue in `ISSUES_REPORT.md` or create a task in `TASKS.md` first, then STOP and wait for user approval.

## 🧭 Product Directive: Travel Planner & Itinerary Builder

- **Template Name:** Travel Planner and Itinerary Builder
- **SEO Targets:** `notion travel planner`, `itinerary builder notion`, `free travel template notion`, `trip planner notion`, `notion vacation planner`
- **Price Point:** Free (lead magnet)
- **Brand:** Moorish Dev | Logo: `assets/moorish_dev_logo.png`
- **Target Audience:** Travelers, digital nomads, and adventure seekers who want a beautiful, all-in-one trip planning workspace inside Notion.
- **Core Requirement:** Every template must be "Plug and Play." A user should be able to duplicate it and start planning their next trip in under 60 seconds.

## 📋 Handoff Protocol

When finishing a session or marking a task as complete, you **MUST** provide a summary in this format:
- **Completed:** `<Detailed list of files created/modified>`
- **Database Schema:** `<Briefly describe any new relations or formulas created>`
- **SEO Status:** `<Key terms targeted in this session>`
- **Gotchas/Next Steps:** `<Crucial context for the next AI agent or session>`
